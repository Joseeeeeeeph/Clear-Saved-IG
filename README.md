# Clear Saved Instagram

### Built for Google Chrome ver. 125.0.6422 - I have only tested this on linux so far

Uses Selenium in combination with Chrome drivers. I am still yet to test this on Windows or MacOS, but have included the corresponding Chrome drivers for this version anyway. The drivers are version specific, so will likely need updating. To deal with this, I have included a custom driver path option. I do not
own the Chrome drivers, and have merely provided them - the license for them can be found in the same folder. Many of the implementation specifics are likely platform dependent.
